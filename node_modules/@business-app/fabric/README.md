# Business App Fabric Experiments

## Consuming BAF in your package (from within the power-platform-ux monorepo)

Add business-app-fabric package as a dependency in your package.json

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@business-app/fabric": "6.0.0",
}
```

## Consuming BAF in your application (from outside the power-platform-ux monorepo)

In order to consume BAF packages in your repo, you need to do the following:

1. Configure npm authentication for your repo. More info [here](../README.md)
2. Install `office-ui-fabric-react`. Fabric is needed for BAF to work correctly, as BAF packages have a peer dependency on Fabric.
3. Install the latest version of `@business-app/fabric`.

Then, you can import the necessary components directly from BAF instead of from Fabric:

```typescript
import { CommandBar, ICommandBarProps } from "@business-app/fabric/lib";

function getCommandBar() {
    let props: ICommandBarProps = { ... }
    return <CommandBar ...props>;
}
```

## Developer workflow

### Building and testing the package

To build this package run `npm run build`.

To run tests, run `npm run test`.

### Testing local changes

To test your local changes run `npm run start`. This will launch the local BAF site which will have your latest changes.

Please note that packages in the monorepo will automatically pick up the latest BAF changes.

### Developing a new component

When you develop a new component, please make sure you add it to the list of components in [groups.tsx](../../apps/business-app-fabric-com/src/groups.tsx)
